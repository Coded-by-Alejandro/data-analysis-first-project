# Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator

## Project Overview
This project is a boilerplate for calculating **mean, variance, and standard deviation** in Python. It was completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis course.  

The project consists of Python scripts and a test module to help learners understand basic statistical calculations programmatically.
